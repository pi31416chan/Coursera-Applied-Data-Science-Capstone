Only 4 launch sites are involved
	[('CCAFS LC-40',), ('VAFB SLC-4E',), ('KSC LC-39A',), ('CCAFS SLC-40',)]

Flight Number and Launch Site does not correlate with a strong power

CCAFS SLC-40 has 100% success rate at payload > 12000

VAFB SLC-4E has very high success rate at payload == 9500
VAFB SLC-4E also has no rocket launch with payload > 10000

KSC LC-39A has 100% success rate at payload <= 5000 and very high success rate at payload > 8000

SSO 100% success rate

VLEO has very high success rate ~87%

LEO orbit the Success appears related to the number of flights

SSO payload ranges from 0 to 4000

GTO payload ranges from 3000 to 8000

VLEO payload > 13000

With heavy payloads the successful landing or positive landing rate are more for Polar,LEO and ISS

sucess rate since 2013 kept increasing till 2020

KSC LC-39A has largest successful launch number & highest successful launch rate

payload ranges from 2000 to 6000 has highest successful launch rate

payload ranges from 6000 to 9000 has highest successful launch rate

FT Booster has highest successful launch rate

Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors4

All 4 models have 0.8333333 accuracy with their respective best parameters
Decision tree has the highest score 0.875 with the train result
Therefore, decision tree performs the best among all 4 methods
